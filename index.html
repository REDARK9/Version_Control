<h2 id="-span-id-page-4-0-span-introduction"><span id="page-4-0"></span>Introduction</h2>
<p>Software development becomes a different beast when you move from working on your own to with a team. Where do you store the project so that every team member has access to it? What happens if more than one person works on the same file at the same time? Programmers often understand the concepts behind source control, but what about artists and other non-technical team members? How can you minimize the amount of support they need from programmers, so they don&#39;t have to worry about doing something wrong?</p>
<p>Source control, or version control, can be a daunting topic for game developers, especially if you&#39;re not from a technical background. But it doesn&#39;t need to be that way. There are a number of tools that integrate with Unity to help your team work effectively with versioning.</p>
<p>This guide explains the key concepts of version control, compares some of the different version control systems (VCS) available, and provides an introduction to additional Unity DevOps tools like Unity Asset Manager, engagement and analytics, game economy, multiplayer services, and more. It provides tips and tricks you can use when setting up your Unity project to help ensure team collaboration is smooth and efficient. Finally, you&#39;ll pick up some version control best practices for working successfully in a team.</p>
<h2 id="-span-id-page-5-0-span-source-control-vs-version-control"><span id="page-5-0"></span>Source control vs version control</h2>
<p>In the beginning of computing, all software development was pure code. Even as 3D graphics evolved, everything was still described as code. As such, the term &quot;source control&quot; was used to describe the systems in place to manage the project&#39;s contents, while the term source code management, or SCM, was given as a label for those tools.</p>
<p>Moving into the modern era of software and game development, we now work with a lot more than just the source code. 3D model formats, such as FBX, textures, materials, audio files, and more, mean that SCMs now have to handle more than just text file changes. The term &quot;source control&quot; no longer covers what we need, and thus &quot;version control system&quot; or VCS, became a more apt description and is now the common label given to the tools used.</p>
<p>The terms can still be used interchangeably. However, when talking about Unity projects that often deal with large binary assets, version control and VCS are most accurate, so that&#39;s how they&#39;ll be referred to throughout the rest of the guide.</p>
<p>Three of the main version control systems that work best with Unity are Unity Version Control (UVCS), (formerly known as Plastic SCM),<sup>1</sup> Git, and Perforce Helix Core. This guide presents the benefits and shortcomings of these systems when working as a team on a Unity project.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> Plastic SCM <a href="https://blog.plasticscm.com/2020/08/codice-software-is-now-part-of-unity.html">joined</a> the Unity family in 2020, which means that these tools are closely integrated into the Unity Editor.</p>
<h2 id="-span-id-page-6-0-span-foundational-concepts"><span id="page-6-0"></span>Foundational concepts</h2>
<p>This section covers some of the core concepts of version control. If you don&#39;t know your &quot;commit&quot; from your &quot;push&quot;, this section will help you understand version control terminology.</p>
<h3 id="how-version-control-works">How version control works</h3>
<p>Version control allows you to keep a historical record of your entire project. It brings organization to your work and enables teams to iterate efficiently.</p>
<p>Project files are stored in a shared database called a repository, or &quot;repo.&quot; You backup your project at regular intervals to the repo, and if something goes wrong, you can revert back to an earlier version of the project.</p>
<p>With a VCS, you can make multiple individual changes and commit them as a single group for versioning. This commit sits as a point on the timeline of your project, so that if you need to revert back to a previous version, everything from that commit is undone and restored to the state it was at the time. You can review and modify each change grouped within a commit or undo the commit entirely.</p>
<p>With access to the project&#39;s entire history, it&#39;s easier to identify which changes introduced bugs, restore previously removed features, and easily document changes between your game or product releases.</p>
<p>What&#39;s more, because version control is typically stored in the cloud or on a distributed server, it supports your development team&#39;s collaboration from wherever they&#39;re working – an increasingly important benefit as remote work becomes commonplace.</p>
<p><span id="page-7-0"></span><img src="_page_7_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="why-use-version-control-">Why use version control?</h2>
<p>Aside from the reasons mentioned above, version control is useful for making experimental changes. You can add a new feature in your local version of the project, and if things don&#39;t work out, you just revert your changes to go back to working on a clean, functional version of the project.</p>
<p>You can iterate on experimental ideas, and if you need to help out on a major issue in the main project, version control allows you to save your changes for a later date. Then you can get your local version back to the main branch to help out with whatever needs to be worked on. Once you&#39;re done, you can restore and carry on with the experimental work.</p>
<p>Most version control systems prevent you from accidentally overwriting work that someone else in your team has done. As you commit your work to the repository, you will also need to &quot;pull&quot; the latest updates from the repository. This allows you to check that someone else hasn&#39;t been working on the same file as you. This is also known as the dreaded &quot;merge conflict,&quot; one of the things that can be scary to people who are not used to version control. However, merge conflicts can usually be resolved easily once you understand the tools. Unity Version Control (UVCS) uses smart locks which helps to reduce the risk of merge conflicts by checking to ensure that locked files on any branch are the latest revision of that file.</p>
<h2 id="centralized-vs-distributed-version-control">Centralized vs distributed version control</h2>
<p>For the most part, version control systems fall into one of two categories: centralized or distributed. Depending on which kind of version control system you work with, some of the terms outlined below will apply, some won&#39;t, and some may even have a different meaning. Let&#39;s take a look at the differences between these two categories.</p>
<h4 id="-centralized-"><strong>Centralized</strong></h4>
<p>The first key difference between centralized and distributed systems is where the repo resides. Many companies choose the centralized option to keep the servers hosting their proprietary software on-site. Source control security is often an important factor in choosing this kind of system. A centralized system doesn&#39;t have to mean on-site servers since the repo can still be hosted in the cloud, but this setup is less common than in distributed systems.</p>
<p><img src="_page_7_Figure_10.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><span id="page-8-0"></span><img src="_page_8_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The other key difference between the two approaches is <em>how</em> users deploy their changes to the repo. Centralized version control is often seen as the more straightforward option. When working with a centralized repo, changes are fetched from and sent to the repository directly. This process is called updating from and committing to the repo.</p>
<p>The downside to this setup is that users must be connected to the server to submit any work. To avoid conflicts, users can lock files for modification. This is known as checking out the file, and it prevents anyone else from committing changes until the file is checked back in.</p>
<p>In a centralized workflow, a user only ever has the latest version of the project files on their workstation, and the server holds the project&#39;s entire history.</p>
<h4 id="-distributed-"><strong>Distributed</strong></h4>
<p>In a distributed workflow, there is still a single location where the repo lives, usually on a cloud service such as GitHub, but users clone the entire project history to their workstation. This allows users to work on their own local copy and commit changes quickly since they don&#39;t need to be connected to a central server. To send those changes so others can access them later, the user needs to push them to the server and pull any other changes down. However, they don&#39;t need to be always working with the latest files like on a centralized system.</p>
<p>Working this way allows you to create a group of changesets that perhaps equate to a larger feature before pushing them up for the rest of your team. In fact, it&#39;s encouraged to commit little and often, but we will get to those best practices later on.</p>
<p><img src="_page_8_Figure_8.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p><span id="page-9-0"></span><img src="_page_9_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>File locking is still available in some distributed workflows, however, it&#39;s less common since you can handle merges more easily. By pulling the latest changes from the server to your local project, you can compare anyone else&#39;s changes to your own to be sure there are no conflicts before pushing your changes to the repo.</p>
<p>While the distributed approach is often preferred, it also has a few disadvantages. Firstly, having the entire project history on local machines takes up a lot of space, especially for teams working with binary file types. Git has an option called Large File Storage (LFS), which converts the history of certain files to text pointers, offloading some of the weight. However, other files have the entire history, and repos can end up with a load of old or stale test data. Studios working with small M2 drives may then find the size of the repo gets bloated with old versions, overloading their drives.</p>
<p>Secondly, as developers don&#39;t have to stay in contact with a central server, they can end up working in isolation for long periods. Their local version can become quite detached from the main repository, and when it comes time to merge their changes back in, this may be more work than they bargained for.</p>
<h4 id="-typical-workflow-"><strong>Typical workflow</strong></h4>
<p>In brief, here are the steps in a workflow for a centralized system and a distributed one:</p>

</ul>
<p>This guide focuses on three main version control systems: UVCS, Git, and Perforce Helix Core. A detailed walkthrough of each VCS starts in the section <a href="#page-37-0">&quot;Version control systems</a>&quot;, but here&#39;s a brief introduction to each one and the workflow it supports:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://unity.com/solutions/version-control">Unity Version Control</a> or UVCS (both): UVCS is a flexible version control system with unique interfaces to support programmers and artists alike. It excels at handling large repos and binary files, and as both a file-based and changeset-based solution, it gives you the capability to download only the specific files you&#39;re working on, rather than the entire project build.</li>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> (distributed): This is one of the most popular version control systems around. Git is open source, free, and flexible. As a platform Git is a command line-only tool. But many different GUIs have been developed for it, making the system more accessible to users.</li>
</ul>
<p><span id="page-10-0"></span><img src="_page_10_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>There can often be some confusion between Git and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, but you can use Git without using GitHub. That said, as any experienced developer reading this will know, GitHub is a very popular service because there is a free version (with some limitations), and it doesn&#39;t require any custom server setups.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core">Perforce Helix Core</a> (centralized): This is an enterprise-level version control system generally used by large game studios because it features centralized repos that are most often hosted on their own servers.</p>
<h3 id="key-terms">Key terms</h3>
<p>Here are the terms for some of the key features and processes in a VCS:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Term</th>
<th>Explanation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Repository/repo</td>
<td>This is the database of all the changes and edits to your project.<br>Stored on a server, either on-site or in the cloud, it holds the full<br>history of the project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Working copy</td>
<td>This is your local version of the project. Sometimes also called<br>a checkout or workspace. You make changes to your working<br>copy, and, when you&#39;re happy with them, commit them to the<br>repository.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commit/check in</td>
<td>A commit encodes file modifications. A centralized workflow<br>sends those changes to the server and is more commonly<br>called checking in. In a distributed workflow, it adds them to the<br>changeset that needs to later be pushed to the server.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pull/update/check out</td>
<td>Pulling or updating retrieves the latest changes available on the<br>server. Check out is the more common term when working in a<br>centralized workflow.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Locking</td>
<td>Locking a file prevents it from being edited by another user. You<br>are telling the server, &quot;I&#39;m working on this; please don&#39;t make any<br>other changes.&quot; Locking is generally not supported in distributed<br>workflows.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Clone</td>
<td>In a distributed workflow, cloning a repo is how you initially get a<br>copy of the project and its entire history onto your local machine.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Tags</td>
<td>Tags are special notes that can be added to a commit. They are<br>often used to mark a point in time where a build was made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Branch</td>
<td>A branch creates a new copy of the codeline, which can then<br>be worked on in parallel. This allows someone to work on parts<br>of the project in isolation, for example a new feature, without<br>affecting the main line of development.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><img src="_page_11_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Merge</th>
<th>Merging can happen either when a branch is finished and needs<br>to be merged back into the main line, or even just when two<br>people make changes around the same time. The two changesets<br>will need to be compared and merged together to create the new<br>working copy. Most merges can be handled automatically.</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>A conflict is what happens when merges cannot be handled<br>automatically. This usually occurs when two people have made<br>changes to the same lines of code or the same binary file.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Conflict</td>
<td>Code conflicts can usually be resolved by comparing the text and<br>working out which changes should be accepted, or even whether<br>both can be brought together in a way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>For binary files, such as Unity scenes or Prefabs, merging a<br>conflict becomes a lot trickier. However, sometimes a quick<br>conversation with the other contributor is the easiest way to<br>resolve what changes make the most sense to keep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pull request</td>
<td>When work on a branch is complete, it&#39;s good practice to open<br>a pull request. This signals to the rest of your team that work on<br>that branch is complete and ready to be merged back into the<br>main line. This system gives team leads and/or seniors a chance<br>to review the changes before accepting them back into the main<br>branch.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Head</td>
<td>Head refers to the latest commit on your working copy.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Reset/revert</td>
<td>Depending on your VCS, reset or revert can be used to discard all<br>your local changes back to their state at the head.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Index</td>
<td>The Git index is a file that describes all the current changes you<br>have in your working copy. These changes sit in what&#39;s known as<br>the staging area, where you can select which changes you want<br>to add to your next commit.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Git stash</td>
<td>If you have some changes that aren&#39;t ready yet for a commit, but<br>you need to move onto some different work, you can use a stash<br>to save those changes in a temporary file and reset your working<br>copy back to head.</td>

<h2 id="-span-id-page-12-0-span-best-practices-for-organizing-a-unity-project"><span id="page-12-0"></span>Best practices for organizing a Unity project</h2>
<p>Regardless of which VCS you choose, there are some generally recommended practices that will help streamline your version control workflow when working in Unity. First, let&#39;s take a look at some of the different ways your team can work together effectively.</p>
<h2 id="project-organization">Project organization</h2>
<h4 id="-folder-structure-"><strong>Folder structure</strong></h4>
<p>Although there is no single way to organize your project, in general, follow these recommendations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Define and document your naming conventions and folder structure as a team. A style guide and/or project template makes your files easier to find and organize. Pick what works for your team, and make sure everyone is on board with it.</li>
<li>Be consistent with your naming convention. Don&#39;t deviate from your chosen style guide or template. If you do need to amend your naming rules, parse and rename your affected assets all at once. In cases where the changes affect a large number of files, consider automating the update using a script.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t use spaces in file and folder names. Use CamelCase as an alternative for spaces.</li>
<li>Separate testing or sandbox areas. Create a separate folder for non-production scenes and experimentation. Subfolders with usernames can divide your work area by team member.</li>
<li>Avoid extra folders at the root level. In general, store your content files within the Assets folder. Don&#39;t create additional folders at the project&#39;s root level unless it&#39;s absolutely necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="_page_13_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>— Keep your internal assets separate from third-party ones. If you are using assets from the Asset Store or other plug-ins, odds are they have their own project structure. Keep your assets separate.</p>
<p>If you find yourself modifying a third-party asset or plug-in for your project, then version control can really help you out when you need to get the latest update for the plug-in. Once the update is imported, you can look through the diff to find where your modifications may have been overwritten and reimplement them.</p>
<p>While there is no set folder structure, here are a couple of examples of how you might set up your Unity project. These structures are based on splitting up your project by asset type. The <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/AssetTypes.html">Asset Types</a> manual page describes the most common assets in greater detail. You can use the Template or Learn projects as an example of organizing your folder structure. While you&#39;re not limited to these folder names, they should give you a good starting point.</p>

<p>Defining a good project structure in the beginning will avoid version control issues later. If you move assets from one folder to another, many VCS will see that as just deleting one file and adding another, rather than the file being moved. This loses the history of the original file.</p>
<p>UVCS can handle file moves within Unity and maintains the history of any file that&#39;s moved. However, it&#39;s essential that when you move a file, you do it in the Unity Editor so that the .meta file moves with the asset file.</p>
<p>The sample scene with the URP template includes a number of asset folders.</p>

<p>Tracking file movements</p>
<p>Once you&#39;ve decided on a folder structure for your projects, use an Editor script to reuse the template and create the same folder structure for all projects moving forward. When it&#39;s placed in an Editor folder, the script below will create a root folder in Assets matching the &quot;PROJECT_ NAME&quot; variable. Doing this keeps your own work separate from third-party packages.</p>

<p>Go to menu &gt; Assets &gt; Create Default Folders. Creating empty folders at the start of your project will help keep your teamwork organized and efficient.</p>
<h3 id="-empty-folders-"><strong>Empty folders</strong></h3>
<p>Empty folders like those shown in the previous images can present a bit of an issue in version control – so only create the folders for what you need. With Git and Perforce, empty folders are ignored by default. If these project folders are set up and someone attempts to commit them, they&#39;ll be unable to until something is placed in the folder.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A common workaround is to place a &quot;.keep&quot; file inside an empty folder. This is enough for the folder to then be committed to the repository.</p>
<p>UVCS can handle empty folders. Directories are treated as entities and have a version history associated with them.</p>
<p>This is a point to note when working in Unity. Unity generates a .meta file for every file in the project, including folders. With Git and Perforce, a user can easily commit the .meta file for an empty folder, but the folder itself won&#39;t end up under version control. When another user gets the latest changes, there will be a .meta file for a folder that doesn&#39;t exist on their machine, and Unity will then delete the .meta file. UVCS avoids this issue by including empty folders under version control.</p>
<p><span id="page-19-0"></span><img src="_page_19_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="-the-meta-file-"><strong>The .meta file</strong></h4>
<p>Unity generates a .meta file for every other file inside the project, and while it&#39;s typically inadvisable to include auto-generated files in version control, the .meta file is a little different. Visible Meta Files mode should be turned on in the Version Control window (unless you&#39;re using UVCS or Perforce modes).</p>

<p>Turn on Visible Meta Files when working with Git.</p>
<p>While the .meta file is auto-generated, it also holds a lot of information about the file with which it&#39;s associated. This is common with assets that have import settings, such as Textures, meshes, audio clips, etc. When you change any import settings on these files, the changes are written into the .meta file, not the asset file. This is why you commit the .meta files to your repository, so everyone works with the same file settings.</p>

<h3 id="-naming-standards-"><strong>Naming standards</strong></h3>
<p>Agreeing on standards doesn&#39;t stop with project folder structure. Setting a naming standard for GameObjects in a scene or prefabs inside project folders can make things easier for your team to understand when you end up working in one another&#39;s files.</p>
<p>Though there is no definitive naming standard for GameObjects, consider the following.</p>

<p>Agreeing on a consistent style across your team can result in a cleaner, more readable and scalable project. The Unity e-book, <em><a href="https://unity.com/resources/create-code-c-sharp-style-guide-e-book?isGated=false">Create a C# style guide: Write cleaner code that scales</a></em>, provides tips and best practices for naming conventions, formatting, classes, methods, comments and more. Overall the guide follows <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions">Microsoft C# style standards 2</a>, providing a Unity-specific subset of that, but there is no one &quot;true&quot; method; the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/csharp-style.html">Google C# 2</a> guide is also a great resource for defining guidelines around naming, formatting, and commenting conventions.</p>
<h4 id="-workflow-optimization-"><strong>Workflow optimization</strong></h4>
<p>Aside from how and where you keep your assets inside the Assets folder, there are several design and development choices you can make to help speed up your workflow, especially when you&#39;re using version control.</p>
<h4 id="split-up-your-assets">Split up your assets</h4>
<p>Large, single Unity scenes do not lend themselves well to collaboration. Break your levels into many smaller scenes so that artists and designers can collaborate better on a single level while minimizing the risk of conflicts.</p>
<p>At runtime, your project can load scenes additively using SceneManager.LoadSceneAsync passing the LoadSceneMode.Additive parameter mode.</p>
<p>Additionally, break work up into Prefabs where possible. If you need to make changes later, you can change the Prefab rather than the scene it&#39;s used in to avoid conflicts with anyone working on the scene. Prefab changes can often be easier to read when doing a diff under version control.</p>
<p><span id="page-22-0"></span><img src="_page_22_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>And if you end up with a scene conflict, <a href="https://unity.com/blog/engine-platform/understanding-unitys-serialization-language-yaml">Unity also has a built-in YAML</a> (a human-readable, data-serialization language) tool specifically for merging scenes and Prefabs. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SmartMerge.html?">Smart merge</a> in the Unity documentation.</p>
<h4 id="presets">Presets</h4>
<p>Unity presets are predefined configurations that allow you to save and reuse specific settings across different components, assets, or tools within a project. Creating a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Presets.html">Preset</a> lets you copy the settings of a component or asset, save it as an asset, then apply the same settings to another item later.</p>
<p>Use Presets to enforce standards or to apply reasonable defaults to new assets. This ensures consistent standards across your team, so commonly overlooked settings don&#39;t impact your project&#39;s performance.</p>

<p>The Preset icon is highlighted here in red.</p>
<p>Click the Preset icon to the top right of the component. Click <strong>Save current to…</strong> to save the Preset as an asset. Click one of the available Presets to load a set of values.</p>
<p><img src="_page_22_Picture_9.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>In this example, the Presets contain different Import Settings for 2D textures depending on usage (albedo, normal, or utility).</p>
<p><span id="page-23-0"></span><img src="_page_23_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Other handy ways to use Presets include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a GameObject with defaults:</strong> Drag and drop a Preset asset into the Hierarchy to create a new GameObject with the corresponding component that includes Preset values.</li>
<li><strong>Associate a specific Type with a Preset:</strong> In the Preset Manager (<strong>Project Settings &gt; Preset Manager</strong>), specify one or more Presets per type. Creating a new component will then default to the specified Preset values.<ul>
<li>Pro tip: Create multiple Presets per type, and rely on the filter to associate the correct Preset by name.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Save and load manager settings:</strong> Use Presets for a Manager window so the settings can be reused. For example, if you plan to reapply the same tags and layers or physics settings, Presets can reduce setup time for your next project.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="-code-standards-"><strong>Code standards</strong></h4>
<p>Coding standards will also help keep your team&#39;s work consistent and make it easier for developers to swap between different areas of your project. Again, there are no set-in-stone rules here. You need to decide what is best for your team – but once you&#39;ve decided, stick with it.</p>
<p>As an example, namespaces can help organize your code better. They allow you to separate modules inside your project and avoid conflicts with third-party assets where class names may end up repeating.</p>
<p>When using namespaces in your code, break your folder structure up by the namespace for better organization.</p>
<p>A standard header is also a good practice. Including a standard header in your code template will help to document the purpose of a class, the date it was created, and even <em>who</em> created it. All of this is information that could easily get lost in the long history of a project, even when using version control.</p>
<p>Unity employs a template script to read from whenever you create a new Monobehaviour in the project. Every time you create a new script or shader, Unity uses a template stored in <strong>%EDITOR_PATH%\Data\Resources\ScriptTemplates</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: <em>C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Data\Resources\ScriptTemplates</em></li>
<li>Mac: <em>/Applications/Hub/Editor/[version]/Unity/Unity.app/Contents/Resources/ ScriptTemplates</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The default Monobehaviour template is this one: <strong>81-C# Script-NewBehaviourScript.cs.txt</strong></p>
<p><img src="_page_24_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>There are also templates for shaders, other behavior scripts, and assembly definitions.</p>
<p>For project-specific script templates, create an Assets/ScriptTemplates folder, and copy the script templates into this folder to override the defaults.</p>
<p>You can also modify the default script templates directly for all projects, but make sure you backup the originals before making any changes. Each version of Unity has its own template folder, so when you update to a new version, you need to replace the templates again.</p>
<p>The original 81-C# Script-NewBehaviourScript.cs.txt file looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
#ROOTNAMESPACEBEGIN#

</code></pre><p>There are two keywords that may be helpful:</p>
<ul>

<h4 id="-ui-toolkit-formatting-conventions-"><strong>UI Toolkit formatting conventions</strong></h4>
<p>UI Toolkit uses UXML code. As it&#39;s inspired by standard web technologies, UI Toolkit uses the kebab-case (also known as dash-case or lisp-case) for naming classes, the same convention used in CSS-related styling systems.</p>
<p>Just as with classes, HTML (and by extension UXML) typically uses kebab-case (lowercase with dashes) for ID names. Therefore, names like my-element-id would be more standard.</p>
<p>However, it&#39;s recommended that the ID names be specific and descriptive to easily identify the element&#39;s purpose. For example, submit-button or main-nav-container, logo-image etc.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Recommended</th>
<th>Not recommended</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Classes</td>
<td>.menu-bar-blue</td>
<td>ButtonBlue</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Visual Element IDs</td>
<td>main-nav-image</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Recommended naming conventions in UXML</p>
<p>The main reasons for using kebab style include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CSS selectors are case-insensitive, so using Camel case or Pascal case (like .buttonBlue or .ButtonBlue) can lead to confusion.</li>
<li>The HTML specification recommends making attribute names all lowercase, meaning .button-blue and not .buttonBlue or .ButtonBlue.</li>
<li>Kebab case is easy to read and write when multiple words are involved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever naming convention you choose to go with, it&#39;s important to be consistent across your codebase. Consistent naming conventions across all types of scripts leads to cleaner code and makes it easier to access and modify by all team members.</p>

<h4 id="-build-automation-"><strong>Build Automation</strong></h4>
<p>Build automation is an integral part of any DevOps strategy. You can run builds on the cloud as well as run builds simultaneously for all your target platforms. Instead of waiting for builds to complete sequentially on your device you can spend that time creating your project.</p>
<p>In the Unity Cloud dashboard you can set up as many build targets as you like from the <strong>Configurations</strong> section.</p>
<p><img src="_page_30_Picture_11.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Click <strong>Quick target setup</strong> to create a Build target (alternatively, you can click Target setup if you want to configure more advanced options).</p>
<p><img src="_page_31_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Choose a platform to build for. You can set up numerous build targets for each platform.</p>
<p><img src="_page_31_Picture_2.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Target platforms to build for</p>
<p>You can build from any branch, and set up multiple targets for each branch. You can also select specific versions of Unity.</p>

<h2 id="-span-id-page-35-0-span-version-control-systems"><span id="page-35-0"></span>Version control systems</h2>
<p>Now that you&#39;re familiar with some of the key terms and concepts in version control, project organization, and <a href="https://unity.com/resources/create-code-c-sharp-style-guide-e-book?isGated=false">naming conventions best practices</a>, it&#39;s time to introduce some of the key players. Of course, no one solution is best for everyone. There are many things to consider when choosing which VCS to use in your team. Hopefully, by the end of this book, you&#39;ll have all the information you need to make that decision.</p>
<h2 id="git">Git</h2>
<p>Open source, free, and flexible, <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is one of the most popular version control systems around. However, as a distributed setup it can be daunting to non-technical users.</p>
<p>Developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds to control the Linux kernel development, it&#39;s remained well-maintained and open source since. Git as a platform is a command line-only tool. But many different GUIs have been developed for it, making the system more accessible to users.</p>
<p>There can often be some confusion between Git and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories, but you can use Git without using GitHub. That said, GitHub is a very popular service because there is a free version (with some limitations), and it doesn&#39;t require any custom server setups.</p>

<p><img src="_page_39_Picture_2.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Sublime Merge</p>
<p>Git is generally considered strong in branching and merging capabilities, but it can&#39;t handle large binary files as effectively as other solutions on the market. Git Large File Storage (LFS) goes some way to rectifying this.</p>
<p>Since Git is a distributed client, the entire repository and complete history is on the developer&#39;s machine. This makes actions such as switching branches or reverting back to a point in history extremely quick. If you&#39;re working on a large project with multiple features and release branches, a Git workflow can save countless hours.</p>
<p>Unity has released their <a href="https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/UnityCsReference">C# editor and engine code to the public on GitHub</a>. This is incredibly useful when you need to know how some functions work or how to replicate a feature of the Editor inside your own project.</p>
<p>GitHub also has its own Git GUI, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>. When working in Unity, you can also use the <a href="https://unity.github.com/">GitHub for Unity</a> package to bring the Git tools directly into the Unity Editor.</p>
<p>As mentioned, GitHub isn&#39;t the only hosting service available for your Git projects. You can also use <a href="https://bitbucket.org/product">Bitbucket</a> (from Atlassian) or <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>, which have many more DevOps features available to them, or one of the many other hosting services available.</p>
<p>See this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISW2nS_v3Ic&amp;t=753s">talk from Unite Now 2020</a> on how to get started with Github, GitKraken and Unity.</p>
<h2 id="-span-id-page-40-0-span-perforce-helix-core-"><span id="page-40-0"></span>Perforce (Helix Core)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core">Helix Core</a> is an enterprise-level version control system generally used by large game studios. These studios use Perforce because it features centralized repos that are most often hosted on their own servers. It does not feature visual repos, so its adoption might be more challenging for non-technical developers, but in larger studios there will be DevOps and Release Engineers to help manage the code base. Plus, as an enterprise solution, it includes a global support team.</p>
<p>Helix Core can also be used by small teams and you can still deploy to the cloud through solutions like <a href="https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core/install-enhanced-studio-pack-aws">Amazon AWS</a> or Microsoft <a href="https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-core/install-enhanced-studio-pack-azure">Azure</a>.</p>
<p><img src="_page_40_Figure_4.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Helix Core P4V interface</p>
<p>Helix Core can handle large files and there&#39;s a built-in Unity Editor integration that&#39;s covered in a later section.</p>

<h2 id="-span-id-page-41-0-span-apache-subversion"><span id="page-41-0"></span>Apache Subversion</h2>
<p>Like Git, <a href="https://subversion.apache.org/">Apache Subversion</a> (known as SVN) is a free and open-source version control system. Unlike Git, it&#39;s a centralized VCS that can handle large binary files. However, it&#39;s still a command line system that requires one of the many third-party GUI clients to be a bit more user friendly. One such client is <a href="https://www.smartsvn.com/download/">SmartSVN</a>.</p>
<p><img src="_page_41_Picture_3.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>SmartSVN GUI</p>
<p>Before Git LFS, SVN was a popular choice when working in Unity. As a centralized solution, it was simpler to work with and, as mentioned, better for working with large files. Where SVN falls behind the other tools is when you start to use branches and need to merge between them. Merging in SVN has many pains, especially when it comes to conflicts – or even false conflicts – between files. A merge operation that would take minutes in another VCS may take hours to go through manually in SVN.</p>
<p>For more information on setting up Unity to work with SVN, check out the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/SmartMerge.html">Unity documentation.</a></p>
<h2 id="unity-version-control">Unity Version Control</h2>
<p><a href="https://unity.com/products/plastic-scm?utm_source=demand-gen&amp;utm_medium=PDF&amp;utm_campaign=asset-links-gmg-achieve-quality&amp;utm_content=version-control-and-project-organization-ebook">Unity Version Control</a> (UVCS) is a flexible version control system with unique interfaces to support programmers and artists alike. It excels at handling large repos and binary files, and as both a file-based and changeset-based solution, it gives you the capability to download only the specific files you&#39;re working on, rather than the entire project build.</p>
<p>There are three ways to access UVCS: via multiple applications and repositories through the UVCS <a href="https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/devops/manual/version-control-desktop-client">desktop client</a>, by adding it to your projects <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/how-to-use-the-unity-hub?courseId=6401bbfcedbc2a22aaebd59b">through the Unity Hub</a>, or accessing the repository on Unity cloud via your web browser. See the section &quot;<a href="#page-61-0">Get started with UVCS in</a>  <a href="#page-61-0">Unity 6</a>&quot; for more information on how to set it up.</p>
<p>Small teams of up to three users can sign up for free and at the time of writing, get up to 5GB of cloud storage, along with access to the Version Control software, including <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/version-control-artists">Gluon.</a></p>
<p>Gluon is a slimline client designed to let artists work like artists, not programmers. It allows you to pick only the files that you&#39;re going to work on and check them out from the server, locking them from being modified by anyone else. Once you complete your work, you check the files back in. The Gluon GUI removes the more complex concepts that work better for programmers than for other, less technical users.</p>
<p><img src="_page_42_Figure_2.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Gluon offers a workflow especially designed for artists, making it easy to preview files and history as well as to check in changes.</p>
<p>For artists, both UVCS and Gluon include ways to diff images. The image diff tool lets you compare two versions of the same file visually, a feature that many other systems don&#39;t offer.</p>
<p><img src="_page_42_Picture_5.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>A diff viewer in Swipe mode: Go from one version to the other by dragging the swipe control, a useful feature for tracking image evolution</p>
<p>The standard UVCS GUI client has all the features they would be looking for and more for the programming team. The GUI has an interactive visual Branch Explorer that shows the true relationships of all the branches in a project. There is also a built-in Code Review system that you can use to request the review of your work from other groups or team members.</p>
<p><img src="_page_43_Figure_2.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The branch explorer visualizes the merge structure of the project. It evolves horizontally from left to right.</p>
<p>One of the key strengths of UVCS is that it has the flexibility to be configured for a distributed or centralized workflow. In fully distributed mode, developers work with a repository on their local machine, checking in, branching, and merging with ease. Developers will then push and pull changes to the server to share them when ready.</p>
<p>In centralized mode, users check out and check in their changes directly to the server so everyone is working on the latest changes. However, as development teams have grown into global organizations, everyone communicating with one central server isn&#39;t always beneficial. UVCS can also be configured to work in a multi-site system. In this system, servers are set up at each site, so teams can check in to their local server, keeping their workflow fast and hard drives happy.

<p>For more information on setting up Version Control in Unity, check out the <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/Versioncontrolintegration.html">documentation</a>.</p>
<h4 id="git-and-other-solutions">Git and other solutions</h4>
<p>For all other VCS, open the <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>Project Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Version Control</strong> window, and select Visible Meta Files from the dropdown menu. There are no other options here, but meta files must be visible in order for version control systems to detect them (see previous chapter on Meta Files).</p>
<h4 id="-what-to-ignore-"><strong>What to ignore</strong></h4>
<p>When working with a Unity project, or any project for that matter, only files that cannot be generated should be placed under version control.</p>
<p>For Unity projects, that means only files in the Assets and Project Settings folders should be committed to your repository. Unity can automatically recreate all the other folders. Under no circumstance should you commit the Library folder, since this folder can get very large and Unity will recreate it when launching the Editor if it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>
<ul>
<li>UVCS automatically selects the appropriate folders and files to place under version control when set up from the Unity Editor. There is a list that is saved in the <code>ignore. conf</code> file at the root of the project that describes which files are ignored. To learn more about setting up the &quot;ignore.conf&quot; file, check out this <a href="https://blog.plasticscm.com/2020/01/definitive-ignoreconf-for-unity-projects.html">blog post</a>.</li>
<li>With Perforce, you need to explicitly add the Assets and Project Settings folders to your depot.</li>
<li>Git requires a <strong>.gitignore</strong> file to indicate what files should never be included. Depending on your Git GUI client, you can select a template when creating a repository, or this can be done through GitHub if you set the hosting up first. Alternatively, a template can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore">here.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You should also avoid committing things like .exe or .apk files. Additionally, gradle and xcode projects built from your Unity project should not be added to the repository.</p>
<p>A small exception to this rule is if you were to set up automated build processes for your Gradle or Xcode projects, but then they would be typically committed to a repository of their own.</p>
<p><span id="page-50-0"></span><img src="_page_50_Figure_1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Files can be added to the ignored list directly from the Unity Editor when using UVCS.</p>
<h4 id="-working-with-large-files-"><strong>Working with large files</strong></h4>
<p>Unity projects are made up of a lot more than just code. In fact, scripts can often be heavily outnumbered by other asset files in a Unity project. These assets are stored as binary files: Textures, models, Prefabs, audio clips, timelines, and so on. This results in two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be hard to compare between revisions.</li>
<li>The diff cannot be described, so the whole file is written when a change is pushed to the repo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, in a distributed environment, the entire project history is available on a user&#39;s local machine. Now if you have a history of large files that have had many changes over a long time, then you will have that many copies of the file stored on your machine. This can quickly consume a large portion of your hard drive space!</p>
<p>This is one of main reasons that historically, teams preferred a centralized workflow. This way, large historical versions of binary files would only live on a central server, with individual users only accessing the latest version on their machines.</p>
<p>Both Perforce and UVCS are centralized systems that can handle large files well. UVCS also gives you the option to work in a distributed pipeline, and large file sizes is the tradeoff that you need to consider when choosing between these options.</p>
<p><img src="_page_51_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Another feature of UVCS is the <a href="https://blog.plasticscm.com/2021/07/dynamic-workspaces-alpha-for-windows.html">Dynamic Workspace,</a> which relies on a virtual filesystem. This means that the Dynamic Workspace downloads files on demand – so, while you see everything in your workspace, in reality not everything is downloaded.</p>
<p>Git, being distributed, can struggle with large files. Be sure to also include <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git LFS</a> if you will be working with large files. Git LFS replaces your large files in the .git folder with text pointers while storing the actual asset on a server such as GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="-span-id-page-52-0-span-best-practices-for-version-control"><span id="page-52-0"></span>Best practices for version control</h2>
<p>Regardless of which VCS you use, many best practices can help your team work more effectively. Every team has different needs, so every practice won&#39;t fit every team.</p>
<p>These tips come from the Unity <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/accelerate-solutions-games">Enterprise Support Team</a>, who are helping to optimize realworld projects for some of the biggest studios out there.</p>
<h2 id="commit-little-commit-often">Commit little, commit often</h2>
<p>This is by far the easiest change you can make to your workflow, yet it&#39;s the one that some developers struggle with the most. When working with other project management tools, it&#39;s likely you have already broken down the work into small, manageable tasks. Commits should be exactly the same.</p>
<p>A single commit should only relate to one task or ticket, unless a single line of code magically fixes several bugs. If you are working on a larger feature, break it down into smaller tasks, and make commits for those tasks. We&#39;ll dive into feature branches later.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of using smaller commits is that when something does go wrong, you will find the change much more easily and can revert the negative change without affecting any other positive changes.</p>
<p><span id="page-53-0"></span><img src="_page_53_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="keep-commit-messages-clean">Keep commit messages clean</h2>
<p>Commit messages describe the history of your project. It&#39;s much easier to find the change that added high-score tables to your game if its commit message says &quot;Added high score tables to the menu&quot; and not &quot;Menu updated!&quot;</p>
<p>When working with a task ticketing system like JIRA or GitLab, it&#39;s even better to include a ticket number in your commit. Many systems can be set up to work together with smart commits, in which you can actually reference tickets and change their status from your commit message.</p>
<p>For example, the commit &quot;JRA-123 #close #comment task completed&quot; would set JIRA ticket JRA-123 to closed, leaving the comment &quot;task completed&quot; on the ticket.</p>
<p>For more on setting this workflow up, see the <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/process-issues-with-smart-commits/">documentation in JIRA</a> or the <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/pivotal_tracker.html#pivotal-tracker-service">Pivotal Tracker</a>  <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/pivotal_tracker.html#pivotal-tracker-service">service in GitLab.</a></p>
<h2 id="avoid-indiscriminate-commits">Avoid indiscriminate commits</h2>
<p>The only time &quot;commit -a&quot; (the git command for &quot;commit all changes&quot;) or any of its counterparts should be used is with the first commit of a project. Usually, this is when the only files in the project are README.md.</p>
<p>A commit should only ever include files that are related to the change you are committing to the repo. Particular care should be taken when working with Unity projects, and some changes may result in several files being marked as changed, such as scenes, prefabs, or sprite atlases, even though you didn&#39;t intend to make any changes to them.</p>
<p>If you accidentally commit a change to a scene that someone else is working on, that could cause a headache for them when they go to commit their changes and find they need to merge your changes first.</p>
<p>This is one of the most common mistakes that people who are new to version control will make. It&#39;s important to understand that you should only commit what <em>you</em> have changed in the project. To learn more, check out this <a href="https://blog.plasticscm.com/2018/10/checkin-with-reviewers-in-mind-how-to-fix-pull-requests.html">blog post</a> on how to speed up your workflow.</p>
<h2 id="-span-id-page-54-0-span-get-the-latest"><span id="page-54-0"></span>Get the latest</h2>
<p>As often as it makes sense, pull the latest changes from the repo into your working copy. It&#39;s not good to work off in isolation, as this only increases the likelihood of merge conflicts. A typical daily workflow in each system would be something like this.</p>

<p>Multi-site configurations can be tailored to custom needs, with each user working in either a centralized or distributed workflow.</p>
<p><span id="page-56-0"></span><img src="_page_56_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Consider the following example of two teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each team has an on-site server.</li>
<li>Team members at both sites check in locally or distributed but benefit from the speed of a close on site server.</li>
<li>Servers push/pull between one another to keep fully or partially in sync.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="_page_56_Figure_6.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Multi-site UVCS configuration</p>
<h3 id="know-your-toolset">Know your toolset</h3>
<p>Whichever VCS your team chooses to work with, make sure that the team is comfortable using it and understands the tools at their disposal including visual clients.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re working with Git, not everyone needs to use the same GUI client. But make sure that everyone is comfortable with the commit &gt; pull &gt; push workflow, and that they know how to commit only the files they need.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re working with UVCS, let your artists get comfortable using <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/version-control-artists">Gluon</a> to simplify their workflow. Gluon lets you decide which files you want to work on and only download those, removing the need to download and manage the entire project. It allows you to lock a file to prevent others from working on it, and, once you&#39;re finished, users can submit files back to the repository and unlock them again.</p>
<p><span id="page-57-0"></span><img src="_page_57_Figure_1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Gluon in UVCS</p>
<p>If you are working with Perforce Helix Core, use the built-in Unity Editor tools for managing version control directly from the Editor. This is incredibly useful, both for artists or for general handling of Unity asset files such as scenes, Prefabs, and so on. You can check out assets for modification in the Editor, make your changes, and then check them back in without even leaving Unity.</p>
<h2 id="feature-branches-and-git-flow">Feature branches and Git Flow</h2>
<p>When you&#39;re working on a long-standing project with multiple release cycles, feature branching is hugely beneficial to your workflow. Often, teams work out of the same branch of a repo that would likely be called trunk, master, or main. When you do this, your entire project moves along the same timeline.</p>
<p><img src="_page_57_Figure_6.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Development along the main branch in UVCS</p>
<p>However, it can be beneficial to split the work off into several branches to work more effectively as a team.</p>
<p>In Git, a specific workflow called Git Flow focuses on using different branches for features, bug fixes, and releases. A developer starts out work on a new feature inside an isolated branch, and when they&#39;re finished, it&#39;s merged back into the main branch. Meanwhile, someone else may have had to do a hotfix on the previous release, fixed a bug, and released a new version safely, without any of the features still under development being included.</p>
<p><img src="_page_58_Figure_3.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>A Git Flow workflow allows for easier release management.</p>
<p>UVCS also features <a href="https://docs.plasticscm.com/book/#_one_task_one_branch">task branches</a>. For this pattern, you create a new branch for every task that you track. While in Git Flow, we use feature branches to develop complete, sometimes large, features, task branches in UVCS are meant to be short-lived. If a task takes more than a handful of commits to implement, odds are it could be broken down into smaller tasks.</p>
<p><span id="page-59-0"></span><img src="_page_59_Figure_1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Perforce Helix Core uses a system called Streams to facilitate this style of workflow. When creating a depot to work in, you need to set it up as a stream depot type. Then, you can use the Stream Graph view to create new streams. Every stream other than the mainline stream will need to have a parent stream, so changes can be copied back up-stream.</p>
<h2 id="pull-requests">Pull requests</h2>
<p>Once you&#39;ve completed work on a feature branch, it&#39;s a good practice to use pull requests to get your changes back into the main stream of the repo. Pull requests are created by the developers of the feature or task, and it&#39;s usually the responsibility of a senior developer or DevOps to review the changes before accepting them into the mainline.</p>
<p><img src="_page_59_Figure_5.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>A closed pull request on GitHub</p>
<p><img src="_page_60_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>UVCS and Perforce both have automated tools to help manage merging branches back into the mainline. UVCS does this with the help of <a href="https://unity.com/solutions/version-control-programmers">Mergebot</a>, which automatically merges branches of a repo once they&#39;ve been reviewed and passed validation. Perforce has an additional platform, <a href="https://www.perforce.com/products/helix-swarm">Helix Swarm</a>, for managing code reviews that can also be set up with automated testing.</p>
<p><img src="_page_60_Picture_2.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>UVCS code reviews are included in the GUI.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://unity.com/products/unity-devops">Unity DevOps offering</a> comprises UVCS and Build Automation. UVCS is free for up to three (3) team members (seats) and up to 5GB of data per month. After that, pricing depends on your monthly active users and total cloud storage. UVCS sends warning emails to the UVCS organization owner when you reach 50%, 75%, and 90% of your usage allowance for any of the UVCS services so it&#39;s easy for you to keep track of your usage.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://unity.com/products/compare-plans/unity-cloud">Unity Cloud pricing plans page</a> for more information or, sign into the Unity Cloud dashboard and go to the <a href="https://cloud.unity.com/home/organizations/default/devops/about">DevOps dashboard &quot;About&quot; page</a>.</p>
<p>There are three ways to access UVCS: via multiple applications and repositories through the UVCS <a href="https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/manual/devops/manual/version-control-desktop-client">desktop client</a>, by adding it to your projects <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/how-to-use-the-unity-hub?courseId=6401bbfcedbc2a22aaebd59b">through the Unity Hub</a>, or accessing the repository on Unity cloud via your web browser.</p>

<p>Setting up Version Control in Unity Hub</p>
<p>This means that your project&#39;s data and files will be stored both locally on your machine, but also on the cloud, in order to help with collaboration and act as a safety backup. The name of your project becomes the name of the repo, and you can choose the server that is closest to you for high speed connections.</p>
<p>The Assets, Packages, and Project Settings folders are backed up onto the server on first use. You can access these files by logging into the Unity Cloud and in the repository select <strong>File Explorer</strong>. This shows you all the files that exist on the cloud repo.</p>
<p><img src="_page_62_Picture_8.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The File Explorer on the Unity Cloud dashboard shows the structure of files and folders in the repo.</p>
<p>UVCS ignores the Library, Logs and User Settings folders, as these are auto-generated on your computer and take up a lot of space.</p>
<p>Other folders that are ignored by UVCS will have a green box with a forward slash icon below the folder or file in the Project window.</p>
<p><img src="_page_63_Figure_3.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Ignored files that are not backed up on the cloud are shown with a green box containing a forward slash.</p>
<p>Be sure to include the Settings folder in the <strong>Pending Changes</strong> section of the Version Control window if the project uses URP or HDRP. If the Settings folder has a forward slash in a green box, select it and right-click. Choose <strong>Version Control&gt; Add to source control</strong>.</p>
<p>The forward slash will become a plus icon in a green circle and these files will now be added to the pending changes list, ready to be uploaded to the cloud.</p>

<p><img src="_page_64_Picture_3.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The <strong>Invite Members to Organization</strong> option in the Version Control window</p>
<p>This will take you to the Unity Cloud login page. Use your Unity ID and password to login.</p>
<p>DevOps will open from the shortcuts on the left and the seats section will then also open, allowing you to add extra seats to your current project. At the time of writing you can&#39;t add more than three seats in the free tier. You can upgrade to Cloud Pro to buy additional seats. See the <a href="https://unity.com/products/compare-plans/unity-cloud">Unity Cloud pricing plans page</a> for more information or, sign into the Unity Cloud dashboard and go to the <a href="https://cloud.unity.com/home/organizations/default/devops/about">DevOps dashboard &quot;About&quot; page</a>.</p>
<p><img src="_page_64_Picture_7.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Add extra seats from the DevOps section on the Unity Cloud.</p>
<p>Assign the new members a seat in your project. They should also be invited to become organization members. This gives them full access to all data on the dashboard for the cloud including usage statistics.</p>
<p>Go to <strong>Administration&gt;Organization members</strong> and click the <strong>invite organization members</strong> button to add extra people to your organization.</p>
<p><img src="_page_65_Picture_2.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Add extra organization members from the <strong>Administration</strong> option.</p>
<p>Assign each member an appropriate role. Choose from guest, user, or admin. Users and admin members can see all projects and you can assign roles in the project members section to give them the appropriate level of access to the project data.</p>
<p>This allows them to access the project and contribute to it based on their role. Users with admin status will have full access to the options available on the cloud.</p>
<p>An email is sent to the other members that you invite.</p>
<p>The invited member should then open Unity Hub and click on the drop down next to the <strong>Add</strong> button and choose <strong>Add UVCS repository</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="_page_65_Picture_8.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Click <strong>Add UVCS repository</strong> to open a project on the Unity Cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: It&#39;s important that all team members are using the same version of Unity, otherwise it can cause issues when converting the project between versions.</p>
<p>This will then download the project from the cloud repository onto the user&#39;s computer.</p>
<h2 id="-span-id-page-66-0-span-check-in-changes"><span id="page-66-0"></span>Check in changes</h2>
<p>As you make changes to your project you will see a green <strong>+</strong> icon on the files that are changed. This shows you which files to check into the server for update.</p>
<p><img src="_page_66_Picture_3.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>A green circle with a plus icon indicates a file has been changed and needs to be checked in.</p>
<p>Update your project often to make rolling back easier. Updated files are shown in the <strong>Pending Changes</strong> section of the Version Control window. Add a short, concise description of the changes you have made and click the <strong>Check in Changes</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="_page_66_Picture_6.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Pending Changes section allows you to check in changes you make to your project.</p>
<p>Other users who are working on the same branch will see a yellow download icon appear in the Version Control window, under the <strong>Incoming Changes</strong> tab. This displays the changes that are made by other users.</p>
<p><img src="_page_66_Picture_9.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Other users can see your checked-in changes and can update their workspace to incorporate them.</p>
<p>They can click the <strong>Update</strong> workspace button to update their workspace and incorporate your changes.</p>
<p><img src="_page_67_Picture_0.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Or they can choose to see the differences from before and after if it&#39;s an existing file that has been modified by right-clicking on the changed file and selecting <strong>Diff</strong>.</p>

<p>Gluon is a version control app that&#39;s artist-friendly.</p>
<p><img src="_page_69_Figure_3.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>UVCS is the full software.</p>
<h2 id="-span-id-page-70-0-span-using-gluon"><span id="page-70-0"></span>Using Gluon</h2>
<p>As explained in the section that introduces UVCS, Gluon is a slim client designed specifically with artists in mind. It allows you to pick only the files that you&#39;re going to work on and check them out from the server, locking them from being modified by anyone else. Once you complete your work, you check the files back in. The Gluon GUI removes the more complex concepts that work better for programmers than for less technical users.</p>
<p>Open Gluon from the installed Unity DevOps Version Control applications.</p>
<p><img src="_page_70_Figure_4.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Gluon desktop app can be found from your installed Unity DevOps software.</p>
<p>It will prompt you to change from full mode to partial mode, the mode which Gluon runs in.</p>
<p>This warning allows you to change to a partial mode when working in Gluon by clicking <strong>Run an update</strong>.</p>
<p>Inside Unity, a <strong>Configure Gluon</strong> button replaces the <strong>branches</strong> icon. This will open the Gluon app every time you click on it.</p>
<p><img src="_page_70_Picture_10.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Team members using Gluon will now be able to open the Gluon app directly from the Version Control window in Unity.</p>
<p>You can enable the dark theme by clicking on the options button at the top right of the Gluon app.</p>
<p><img src="_page_71_Picture_1.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>In Gluon you can use the options drop down at the top right to enable the dark theme.</p>
<p>Gluon uses the main branch only, providing a visual, artist-friendly workspace. You can use Gluon to easily access the <strong>Explore workspace</strong> feature to upload and download files as needed.</p>
<p>In the Explore workspace section click the <strong>Configure</strong> button to make changes to the files on the repo.</p>
<p><img src="_page_71_Picture_5.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Configure</strong> button to make changes to files on the repo.</p>
<p><img src="_page_71_Picture_7.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Select the files you need to download and click Apply in Gluon.</p>
<p>Click on the checkboxes next to files to either download or remove from the Explore workspace view. Files that will download to the Unity Editor turn green and files that you want to remove from Unity will turn red. Click <strong>Apply</strong> when done and then <strong>Update workspace</strong> so the files will be available in your version of Unity.</p>
<p>Even if you delete files inside of Gluon they only relate to this current changeset and any future changesets you create. The files will still be on the cloud as they will be referenced by previous changesets.</p>
<p>You can see the visual change of a texture that has numerous revisions by right-clicking on a revision in the options section on the right side of the Gluon app and selecting <strong>Diff with previous revision</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="_page_72_Picture_2.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>See a visual change between revisions by selecting <strong>Diff with previous revision</strong>.</p>
<p>This will show the differences between the previous revision and the current one.You have a few options in which to view this including swipe, which lets you drag a swipe slider along the image to view before and after.</p>

<h2 id="uvcs-desktop-app">UVCS desktop app</h2>
<p>The UVCS desktop app is the full, complete version control software suitable for team members who want access to branching. You can open it from the installed Unity DevOps Version Control applications.</p>
<p>If you used Gluon previously, it will prompt you to change from partial mode to full mode, the mode which UVCS runs in.</p>
<p>Change from partial mode to full mode for UVCS desktop version control software.</p>
<h2 id="branches">Branches</h2>
<p>Branches allow different team members to work on the same project independently of each other. For example, a team member might create a new feature on a separate branch, while other team members work on the main branch. Features can be things like creating the code for achievements, adding the mechanics for different types of pickups, etc.</p>
<p>When they complete their task they can merge their branches back into the main branch. All team members working on the project will then be able to update their workspace to incorporate all the work that has been done.</p>
<p>When you select the Branch Explorer within the Version Control window in the Unity Editor, it opens the UVCS app and takes you to the Branches section.</p>
<p><img src="_page_73_Picture_11.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>You can open the Branch Explorer section of the UVCS desktop app.</p>

<p><img src="_page_74_Picture_4.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>The Create a branch from a changeset option</p>
<p>You will now be working on a separate branch. Any changes made by team members on the main branch or other feature branches will not be sent to you. This reduces the risk of someone else&#39;s changes conflicting with your progress. You can update their changes later after merging.</p>
<p>Branches can have multiple changesets marked by circles just like the main branch.</p>
<p>When you complete your work on the branch you can merge your branch back to the main one by right-clicking and choosing <strong>Merge from this changeset to…</strong>.</p>

<p>The Diff viewer shows the differences in the code between your file and the one on the branch you want to merge with.</p>
<p>This can help you to decide whether to overwrite the file on the other branch with your file. To do this choose <strong>Merge keeping source changes</strong>:</p>
<p>Or you can discard your changes and keep the original file on the other branch. To do this choose <strong>Merge keeping destination changes</strong>:</p>
<p>Finally, you can choose <strong>Merge selected files</strong> and UVCS will merge the two files together attempting to keep both sets of changes, although you should check the script after the merge to ensure it has done this correctly:</p>

<h2 id="merge-rules">Merge rules</h2>
<p>A good idea is to implement merge rules to prevent merge conflicts from disrupting your team&#39;s workflow. This can be used in larger teams where team managers want to approve a branch before allowing it to be merged into the main branch. This prevents introducing errors into the main workflow.</p>
<p>Log into the Unity Cloud dashboard, go to <strong>settings</strong>, then <strong>Merge rules</strong>.</p>

<p>Code reviews show the ongoing progress of requested reviews.</p>

<p>Reviewers can click the <strong>Mark Review</strong> button to mark it as rework required or reviewed.</p>
<p>Once the branch is reviewed it can then be merged. This adds extra security to your project.</p>
<p>You can also do the same procedure for code reviews on a specific changeset. This might be useful when you want other team members to review your code for bugs or issues, or perhaps suggest ways to improve the code.</p>
<p>To do this, right-click on a changeset and choose <strong>New code review for this changeset</strong>. You can then invite team members to check your files and give recommendations.</p>

<p>Right-click on the changeset and choose <strong>Label this changeset</strong>. Labels prevent the changeset from being deleted. You can remove a label from the labels section if necessary.</p>
<p><img src="_page_83_Figure_3.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Label a changeset from the right-click menu. Labels give other users important information about this changeset.</p>
<h2 id="locking-files">Locking files</h2>
<p>Locking a file while you are working on it can prevent major merge conflicts. This file will then be locked on the cloud, preventing other team members from making changes to it while it&#39;s locked (they can still access the file in a read-only format). Once the file is checked back in, the lock is removed and other team members can make changes to it.</p>
<p>Locks are not automatically applied. By default, when you save your progress in Unity, any files you are working on will be marked with a checkout icon.</p>
<p><img src="_page_83_Picture_9.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>A purple checkout icon appears on the file icon in Unity and also on everyone else&#39;s versions, letting them know that somebody is working on the file.</p>
<p>The checkout icon in a purple box is displayed on the file on every team member&#39;s computer.</p>
<p>You can manually checkout a file before you begin working on it. Click the <strong>Checkout</strong> button in the Inspector. Other team members will see that you are working on the file, however, this is not a file lock, so other team members can still make their own changes to the same file. This is not as effective as using file locking.</p>
<p><img src="_page_83_Picture_13.jpeg" alt=""></p>
<p>Checkout a file when you are making changes to warn other team members that you are working on it.</p>
<p>UVCS uses smart locks. This ensures that other team members who want to make changes to this file will be forced to use the latest revision of the file. This is important, as you may be working on a branch that is using an older version of that file. Smart locks checks all branches including the main to find the latest revision of this file and ensures you are working from that version and not an outdated older version.</p>
<p>To lock files, go into the Branch Explorer.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Workspace Explorer</strong> view find the file you want to lock, right-click on it and choose <strong>Lock and checkout</strong>. This only works as long as no other team member has checked the file out.</p>

<h2 id="-span-id-page-93-0-span-conclusion"><span id="page-93-0"></span>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hopefully this guide will help you to feel more comfortable working with version control as part of a team in Unity. Even if you&#39;re working on a solo project, the principles of organizing your project and using version control can be really useful.</p>
<p>The biggest takeaway is the importance of clear team communication and agreement on tools, processes, structure and code style. As a team, you need to agree on your guidelines: how you should structure your project, which version control system to use, and how your workflow in that system looks. Then, when you start integrating other tools such as JIRA, GitLab, build tools, or automated testing, the work you&#39;ve already done structuring your project and workflow will really come into its own.</p>
<p>Finally, check out the following resources to find a wealth of information on the various version control systems discussed in the book, plus more tips on setting up your Unity project for success.</p>
